# Personal Portfolio

This project contains the react app and its respective component created as its basis. All components where created using CSS and JS directly so no further dependencies are necessary. 

##Content

The actual  webpage content consists of a brief description of myself as a software developer, specifically a front end developer, a segment for the abilities y have experience with and the projects I have worked on as of recently in web development.

The components can be used in other projects although the project components will require a custom react component to be used as the hidden information container.
