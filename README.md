# Personal-Portfolio-Eduardo-Sierra
React application containing the code for my personal web page detailing some of my projects and abilities as a front end developer.

This application showcases a use of CSS to create animations using the native tools available as well as the implementation of JS inside of REACT components to manipulate CSS attributes to create the end result.

Several components can be reusable for general purposes although other components containing the content of how the projects where executed, might only be used only very similar circumstances. In which case it is adviced to use the component as a template and to change the JSX and JS code accordingly.
